Description: Exporting 'shiny' applications with 'shinylive' allows you to run them entirely in a web browser, without the need for a separate R server. The traditional way of deploying 'shiny' applications involves in a separate server and client: the server runs R and 'shiny', and clients connect via the web browser. When an application is deployed with 'shinylive', R and 'shiny' run in the web browser (via 'webR'): the browser is effectively both the client and server for the application. This allows for your 'shiny' application exported by 'shinylive' to be hosted by a static web server.
