# Basic example of a GitHub Actions workflow that builds a Shiny app and deploys
# it to GitHub Pages.
#
# The agreed upon contract is:
#
# - Inspect the root directory for package dependencies
# - Install R and the found packages
# - Export the Shiny app directory to `./site`
# - On push events, deploy the exported app to GitHub Pages
#
# If this contract is not met or could be easily improved for others,
# please open a new Issue https://github.com/posit-dev/r-shinylive/
#
# The _magic_ of this workflow is in the `shinylive::export()` function, which
# creates a static version of the Shiny app into the folder `./site`.
# The exported app folder is then uploaded and deployed to GitHub Pages.
#
# When deploying to GitHub Pages, be sure to have the appropriate write
# permissions for your token (`pages` and `id-token`).
